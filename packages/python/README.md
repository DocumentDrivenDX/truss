# Truss Python delivery

Truss owns the tested embeddable Python implementation. The complete engine
package is under implementation; current files provide the pinned local runtime
candidate, not released mutation/query/installation APIs.

For local PostgreSQL:

```sh
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install './packages/python[local]'
.venv/bin/python scripts/local-postgres.py --data-dir .local/truss-postgres
```

Run from the repository root. Stop with Ctrl-C; data survives. `--probe` starts,
checks readiness and stops. This component uses pgserver0.1.4 with its actual
bundled PostgreSQL16.2 on the qualified macOS arm64 tuple. It performs no Truss
installation or migration. Use a host-supplied connection for external PostgreSQL;
pool configuration/operation belongs to the host.

See the [installation and migration execution plan](../../docs/helix/04-build/local-runtime-installation-migration-plan.md)
for the complete delivery scope and independent acceptance scenarios.

Rollback-only native profile checks (same environment):

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/check-pgserver-layout.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/check-pgserver-adjuncts.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/check-pgserver-umf-structure.py
```

Each creates its own disposable server and rolls back all review DDL. The last
compares the UMF schema-browser model with actual columns and FK mappings; it
is not a complete installer or migration verifier.

Embed the local runtime in Python3.11:

```python
from truss import LocalPostgres

with LocalPostgres('.local/truss-postgres') as runtime:
    uri = runtime.info.connection_uri
    # Open a connection with your PostgreSQL driver. Close it before context exit.
```

The context owns only its local server lifecycle. Callers own their connections
and transactions. Exit stops the server and retains its data, including after a
caller exception. Use a new context to restart. Same-directory contexts refuse
immediately through process-local and interprocess leases. Existing postmaster
custody, nonempty non-PostgreSQL directories and incompatible major versions
refuse without automatic retry, takeover or migration. The local candidate admits
bundled16.2; other platform/version tuples still require qualification.

The experimental truss-toolkit0.0.1.dev0 wheel exposes this lifecycle component;
it does not yet expose the complete Truss engine, catalog acceptance, mutation,
query or migration APIs. Test with `python -m unittest discover -s packages/python/tests -v`.

If cleanup raises or leaves a postmaster marker, close refuses and retains the
directory lease; connection information becomes unavailable. It does not retry
automatically. The host may explicitly call `close()` again after resolving the
failure. A successful close releases custody only after the owned cleanup returns
and its postmaster marker is absent. Startup failures inside pgserver's constructor,
crash recovery and other operating systems still need separate qualification.

Already admitted exact-value conveniences are available in `truss.numeric` and
`truss.timestamp`:

```python
from truss.numeric import decimal_from_admitted_text
from truss.timestamp import timestamp_from_admitted_text

amount = decimal_from_admitted_text('12345678901234567890.123456789', 128)
assert amount.original_text == '12345678901234567890.123456789'
time = timestamp_from_admitted_text('2026-10-09T12:34:56.123456789Z', 64)
assert time.datetime_view is None  # Python datetime cannot preserve nanoseconds.
```

The caller must first admit source grammar, UMF field meaning and native domain.
These functions retain original spelling and require a caller-selected finite byte
bound; they perform host conversion only. Decimal construction ignores ambient
precision, but subsequent Decimal arithmetic follows the caller's context and is
not qualified here. Integer host input rejects bool and float. Timestamp tokens
retain their original offset/precision even when a datetime view is unavailable.
These adapters do not normalize keys or define an alternative UMF grammar or codec.

For populated local guard qualification, run
`python scripts/check-pgserver-populated-guards.py` in the local runtime environment.
It checks12 immutable row/statement refusals using explicit FK-valid administrative
fixtures under rollback. It performs no protected engine or installer publication.

Declared migration metadata planning is available experimentally:

```python
from truss.migration_planning import plan_layout_migration

result = plan_layout_migration(manifest_bytes, observation_bytes, '2.0.0')
# Inspect result.outcome: plan, no_steps or refused.
```

Inputs are immutable original numeric-free JSON bytes and a bounded target version.
Only explicitly declared complete routes are selected; no route is synthesized
from intermediate steps. Results and nested artifact views are frozen. This
function performs no database I/O, retries, installation verification or migration
execution. Even `no_steps` requires independent full installation verification.
Keep original artifact bytes separately; decoded views provide no authority.

An experimental synchronous compiler boundary is available in `truss.weft`:

```python
import weft  # Separately delivered, verified original Rust/PyO3 extension.
from truss.weft import CompilerBoundary

compiler = CompilerBoundary(weft.compile_json)
compiled = compiler.compile_request(original_weft_request_bytes)
artifact = compiled.artifact
compiler.dispose()
```

The complete original request uses Weft's frozen compile0.2 / SQL0.2 grammar,
Truss PostgreSQL target and original owner model/binding bytes. Rust owns SQL
parsing and lowering. The boundary checks byte/hash and returned context
correspondence, retains immutable original request/response bytes, and freezes
nested artifact views. Parameter values remain exact text; decimal JSON metadata
is decoded as Decimal with original spelling retained in the response bytes.
Blocked input/compiler responses return a single CompileRefusal; callback errors
propagate without retry. Disposal prevents publication and new compilation.

The callback must come from the host's verified original source/build; supplying
a function cannot prove its compiler pin. No Weft wheel is currently published or
declared as a truss-toolkit dependency. The development wheel and compiler checks
are recorded in the Python implementation handoff. A compiled artifact is not a
native execution permit: this component has no database connection or execute
method. Host obligation admission, current-person read context, exact result
decoding and complete execution/profile qualification remain unfinished.
